Describe how would you set up the env so it scales automatically when response time drops below 20ms.

Have only one autoscaling configuration in which we can have multiple profiles with more autoscaling rules/policies

Application can have a threshold defined for the expected traffic throughput rate. If it falls below a specified threshold (20ms), 
the autoscaling congiuration in the EKS cluster will scale based on the specified maximum pods/containers/nodes. When the threshold is back to normal,
it will scale down to desired numbers.

Always we need to ensure the max and min values are different and have adequate margin between them.

Also, when someone manaually change the desired counts to a value above or below the maximum, the autoscaling config should scale back to the desired counts.

Setting diagnostic metrics properly will help autoscaling to be appropriate.

Configuration for notifying the autoscaling operations.
